# Portals

This is a demo made in unreal showing different portals I made.

I made 4 portals for this demo which are:
- Normal teleporting portal
- Level portal which will either reset the current level or move the player to a new level
- Scaling portal that scales whatever travels through it
- Rotating portal that will rotate whatever goes through it
